# Toddle interview backend task

### Hosted on

-   The live url of backend is -
-   Hosted on EC2 t2.micro
-   Used Nginx as reverse proxy running on same instance and added TLS on it
-   Postgres db is also running on same instance

### Before running locally

-   Make sure Node.js 14+ & Postgres server is installed
-   The migrations will create the database as well, so it will first connect to default `postgres` database. Make sure that `postgres` database is not deleted & user have access to connect to `postgres` database.

### How to run locally

-   Once you are at root of this project, do `npm install`
-   run `cp sample.env .env`
-   Populate `.env` with required values. Please do not change `DB_DATABASE` value.
-   run `node db/migrate.db.js` to run all the migrations. It will create database. and its tables.
-   run `npm run dev` to start the node server

### Postman Collection

-   The collection is public [here](https://www.postman.com/ym-356609/workspace/ym-team/collection/16305790-832c639b-bd7a-4e8d-ae20-4caa83107411?action=share&creator=16305790)
-   If you are testing locally, use `toddle-local` postman environment. To test hosted version, use `toddle-ec2` postman environment. This will properly set the `url` variable of collection requests.
-   The collection's documentation can be found [here](https://www.postman.com/ym-356609/workspace/ym-team/documentation/16305790-832c639b-bd7a-4e8d-ae20-4caa83107411)
-   On running the auth-jwt api (of student or tutor), collection variable `tutor_jwt` or `student_jwt` will be automatically set and used for all future tutor/student apis. You can verify this in Headers section of each request.

### Database schema diagram

-   Please note as this is assignment, only minimum required fields are used, in real-world, each table would have many meaningful fields.
-   Schema diagram can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fnWHnXkUHoHBziLjimchd73du1tU--5G/view)

### File storage

-   To make it easier for reviewer to run locally, uploaded files are stored on server directly. (Else reviewer would need to create his/her own S3 bucket, generate access keys & use them locally)
-   Ideally in production, we would be storing the files on S3 or similar & deal with signed-urls as needed

### Report issues

-   I have double checked all steps of running server, file permission, postman collection permission, etc to make sure that the review process is seamless.
-   However, in case I missed something or you are facing any issue in review process, please do let me know & I will assist quickly

### Cleanup steps

-   Once the review is done, to delete all database changes, run `node db/rollback.db.js`
-   Delete the code files.
-   If you had fork the postman collection, you can delete that as well.
